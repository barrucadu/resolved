Guides
======

This section provides how-to guides to do what you want with `resolved`:

- **[Use a DNS blocklist.](./guides/use-a-dns-blocklist.md)** Using and creating
  your own blocklists, to do things like block advertising domains or prevent
  certain websites from being available.

- **[Override a DNS record.](./guides/override-a-dns-record.md)** A more
  powerful version of DNS blocklisting, allowing you to totally change how
  existing domains behave.

- **[Set up LAN DNS.](./guides/set-up-lan-dns.md)** So you can provide DNS
  blocklisting, overrides, and local name resolution to all machines on your
  network.
